# OxiDD_visualizations
Python files and Notebooks for OxiDD visualizations.
This code just shows how the visualizations were created.

For the code to work, one needs to install OxiDD from this branch: https://github.com/TarVK/oxidd

```
python -m pip install "oxidd @ git+https://git@github.com/TarVK/oxidd.git@feature/visualize"
```

Once run the resulting BDD and/or ZDD can be found at https://oxidd.net/viz/. 
Click on 'Add diagram source' and add your host adress. After running the code, a box with BDD and/or ZDD will appear. 
When you click on this box, a visualization will appear.
